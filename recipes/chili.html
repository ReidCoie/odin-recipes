    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat a dutch oven pot over the stove and medium-high heat. 
            While it's preheating, we'll prep the other ingredients
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Dice the onion and chop the bell pepper and jalapeno to have them prepped and ready. 
            Once cut up, set aside for later.
        </li>

        <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, mix the ground beef with the chili powder, salt, and pepper. 
            Make sure that all those seasoning are mixed well before putting it the dutch oven.
            Brown the beef in the dutch oven. Drain the grease when done.
        </li>

        <li>
            Once the beef is browned, dump the diced onion and chopped bell pepper and saute the vegetables with beef
            for around 4-5 minutes or until the onions are golden.
        </li>

        <li>
            Dump the beans, canned tomatoes, and beef broth in with the meat and vegetables. Add the jalapeno, chili powder,
            and cumin then stir. Season to taste with salt.
        </li>

        <li>
            Bring the pot to a boil then reduce to a simmer. Let it simmer for about 30 minutes. If a thicker chili is 
            desired, sit for closer to 45 minutes.
