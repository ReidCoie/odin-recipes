    <h2>Scrambled eggs with cheese</h2>

    <p>
        Let's make a delightful meal with one of natures most nutrient rich resources. And today we're going to scramble
        them, because doing it any other way is <strong>gross</strong>! We'll also throw in some cheese to add an extra dimension to 
        the flavor. Hello Gordon!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 large white eggs, or however many you'd prefer</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of olive oil</li>
        <li>Half a cup of triple cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat a nonstick pan to medium heat. While preheating, pour a small amount of olive oil to heat with the pan
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack all the eggs into a mixing bowl and add the salt and pepper, then beat with a fork or whisk. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once beaten, pour the eggs into the pan, then sprinkle in a healthy amount of shredded cheese.
            Continually stir the eggs around while they curdle. This insures a fluffy scrambled egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once it is to a desired consistency, remove from the heat and serve. Add salt and pepper if desired.
